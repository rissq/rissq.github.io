<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p><strong>Industry and Business need Statistics for their survival and development</strong>. Being this an
axiom difficult to contradict, and having the statistical software R had an
impressive increase of use<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, it would be expected that statistical methods for quality
control and improvement had had a similar evolution. However, even though some
companies are starting to use R for those methods, there is a long way to attain
the usage and confidence <em>standard</em> commercial tools have reached<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Actually,
in many companies R is being used thanks to a handful of R-enthusiastic
practitioners working there.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical methods for quality control and improvement are basically general statistical methods</strong>
applied to industry. Thus, the use of <em>base</em> R in industrial environments
should be natural, as the R software applied to industry standards provides the flexibility
to implement new methods quickly, and could not only mimic the <em>standard</em> commercial software, but
improve it, speeding up innovation. However, R face the
same drawbacks that other business applications. On the one hand, the lack
of a sort of <em>seamless</em> Graphical User Interface (GUI) for standardised tasks
is a barrier to use R by non-statistically-skilled professionals. We know that
this is not optimal (one should know what the software does, not just <em>click and see</em>),
but it is also true that, in many cases, the statistical tools are just <strong>standardised</strong>
procedures and it is enough for the sake of the business to interpret the
outputs by some engineer, manager, or alike,
given the correct input. On the other hand,
the specifics of the quality control methods, for example related to the
way things are named, or how to present the results, it is often needed to adapt
the base functions in order to present the results in an understandable way
for the experts in the matter. Sometimes this is very easy just writing a
function that wraps base functions. Other times, more complex software
development is needed, for example via R packages.</p>
<p>Some packages
that cover some quality control and improvement topics are available at CRAN.
The <code>qcc</code>
package <span class="citation">[1]</span> is probably the first contact a quality control practitioner has with R.
Its functions to produce quality control charts are well valued by
practitioners (see Fig. <a href="#fig:qcc">1</a>). Other R packages like <code>qualityTools</code> <span class="citation">[2]</span>,
<code>qcr</code> <span class="citation">[3]</span>, <code>qicharts</code> <span class="citation">[4]</span>, <code>SixSigma</code> <span class="citation">[5]</span>,
or <code>AcceptanceSampling</code> <span class="citation">[6]</span>, among others,
are available for different quality control and improvement tasks.</p>

<p><strong>The seminal idea for this proposal</strong> actually arose in 2011 from my interest
on the topic during my Masters Studies. The Masters thesis <span class="citation">[7]</span>
paved the way for a continuous work on the topic since then, including a
non-stopping learning about the real needs of industry. A manuscript entitled
“An Introduction to Six Sigma Tools With R” was submitted to the R Journal.
It was rejected, but,
far from being discouraging, that provided new inputs and insights for further
work. In fact, the rejected paper became a chapter of the book “Six Sigma with R”
<span class="citation">[8]</span> published later together with
the <code>SixSigma</code> package.
Some of the comments by one of the anonymous reviewers provided relevant
input for this project<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. At the beginning, this review puzzled us the authors as R enthusiasts.
But during the subsequent years
working on the topic, I eventually think that something must be done from the
R ecosystem to convince industry.</p>
<p><strong>Industry works with Standards, rather than with text books.</strong> The
software developed for industry should take into account industry standards.
Ideally, computational statistics developers should participate in the development of statistical standards.
Thus, the aim of this project is to build the needed R Infrastructure with
the language and procedures of industry, i.e., the Standards. Moreover, the
RISSQ will help industry in the verification process, i.e., verify that the software
does what the Standards say. By two means: through the Open Sourced code, and through
the automatic verification of the numerical examples in the Standards.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-plan" class="section level1">
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>The RISSQ project was proposed twice to the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) of the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a> looking for funding for its development.
The ISC supports projects that broadly help the R community.
This support might be software development, developing new teaching
materials, documenting best practices, promoting R to new audiences,
standardising APIs or doing research. This proposal tackles several of
those topics, and <strong>Statistical methods for quality control and improvement</strong>
is a topic in which commercial
software is still dominant. This project could
be relevant for spreading R among industry and business by filling the existing
gaps. <strong>International standards</strong>, well known and accepted by the industry,
will be a catalyst for adopting R. However, the proposal did not
convince the committee that the
project would impact a sufficiently broad segment of the R Community.</p>
<p>Nontheless, the project is clearly of interest for companies and practitioners.
Industry users of the <code>SixSigma</code> package have sent feedback supporting the project,
and a letter of interest was sent by Philips Lighting<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. The project has also being outlined in several presentations<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> receiving encouraging comments. Check the updated list of <a href="/supporters">supporters</a>. Thus, I have decided to start the project with my own resources (mainly, time and will) and the aid of internship students (unpaid, until funds come). Check the updated list of <a href="/people">contributors</a>. Next, the inital work plan is shown, even though we are running the project in a sort of freestyle.</p>
<p><strong>The work plan is organised in 4 Work Packages</strong> (WP) with disaggregated tasks.
All WPs finish in verifiable Milestones. The project is planned to be
completed in two years (M1–M24). The Gantt Chart below summarizes the timing.</p>
<p><img src="/project_files/figure-html/fig-fullwidth-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In summary<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, the project starts gathering the “Standards Library”, i.e., the identified international
standards from ISO Technical Committee 69 (Applications of statistical methods)
and AIAG (Automotive Industry Action Group)
containing methods to be implemented in R, e.g., (number of documents
in parenthesis): AIAG MSA (Measurement Systems Analysis) and SPC (Statistical Process Control)
Manuals (2);
ISO 7870 series, control charts (9); ISO 22514 series, capability analysis (9);
ISO 5725 (5), 11648 (2) and 11843 (7) Series, Measurement methods and results (TC 69/SC 6), Acceptance Sampling (TC 69/SC 5).
Then, before implementing
methods, the basic infrastructure is to be developed, i.e., a git project, the data structures,
classes, functions common features, verification process, a Shiny App and
a website. Next,
in WP2, the methods in the Standards are to be implemented, sequentially by
group (control charts, capability analysis, and measurement systems analysis).
The validation and deployment carried out
in WP3 is done after each group of standardised methods is developed. Finally, WP4 tasks assure
the project coordination and dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>The RISSQ will be developed under the R paradigm</strong> of
providing easy ways of producing results with few options, scaling
to more elaborated results via options and parameters. Thus, based on the basic
infrastructure outlined above, low-level functions will contain the implemented
standardised methods. When not in contradiction with the standards, already existing
functions in the R base distribution will be recycled. This will result
on an API that can be consumed: (1) by the RISSQ shiny App, which will be
used not only for demonstration, but also as an in-house downloadable
solution, And customizable by R experts and/or companies;
and (2) by third parties,
developers, and companies that want to build new solutions upon the base layer
of the infrastructure. In addition to the people directly involved (see below),
a group of stakeholders<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
are willing to collaborate with the project providing
real data sets and feedback.
Table <a href="#tab:tasks">1</a> shows a summary of the tasks to be carried out<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

<p><strong>The more likely failure mode for the project is not getting funded</strong>.
In the event of the lack of resources, I will continue developing the <code>SixSigma</code>
package trying to implement the standards approach<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>
along with the users feedback.
Apart from that, the project can
be threaten by the insufficient expertise of the researcher to be contracted.
In that case, I will allocate more hours from my time for training and development.
Finally, some intellectual property issues could arise. I will mitigate this
risk by checking with the standardisation committee I am involved each new version.</p>
<p><strong>The resources needed for the project</strong> are gathered in Table <a href="#tab:resources">2</a>.
Two roles will participate in the work: Senior Researcher (SR) and Junior Researcher (JR).
SR planned work will be mainly done by the project leader, with the support of
the <a href="https://previa.uclm.es/varios/catalogoinves/grupos.aspx?gr=293&amp;inf=rch">research group team at UCLM</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.
A pre-doc contract will be offered for contracting a
PhD Student to do the JR planned work before the stay at Philips Lighting.
The offer will be disseminated over the
R Community, with special emphasis to R-Ladies groups, as we are committed
with the gender gap. Dissemination is an important topic for the success of the project.
We plan to attend, not only R/Stats conferences,
but also Standards/Industry events, which will be crucial for the adoption of the infrastructure.
Indirect costs complete the project budget, according to the rules of the University of
Castilla-La Mancha<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Non-financial support is also welcome</strong>.
Beyond the dissemination to the R ecosystem, it is important for the project
success to reach industrial stakeholders. A first and easy step is
bringing the project to the attention of companies that already are <em>with</em> R<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Another possible
contribution would be to support the participation
in the standardisation committees. In particular, the R community could be
represented in the Technical Committee ISO/TC69 (and subcommittees) not only
to implement the standards on the software, but also to contribute to the
establishment of sound statistical standards for industry.</p>
